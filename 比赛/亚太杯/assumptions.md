\subsection{Assumption 1}
We assume that the global economic environment will remain relatively stable over the next three years (2024-2026), without major economic crises or dramatic policy changes that could significantly impact the pet industry. This assumption allows us to:

Use historical data to predict future trends
Apply time series analysis methods effectively
Make reasonable extrapolations from current market conditions

\subsection{Assumption 2}
We assume that the key factors influencing pet industry development will maintain their current relationships and relative importance. Specifically:

The correlation between economic indicators (GDP, disposable income) and pet industry growth will remain consistent
Demographic factors (urbanization rate, aging population, single-person households) will continue to impact the industry in similar ways
Consumer preferences and pet-keeping habits will evolve gradually rather than change abruptly

\subsection{Assumption 3}
We assume that data from existing markets can be used to predict emerging market behavior, with appropriate adjustments for:

Different stages of market maturity
Cultural and economic differences between regions
Varying rates of pet ownership and industry development
Local regulatory environments and market structures
