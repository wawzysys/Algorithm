Algorithm 1 Pet Food Demand Prediction
Require: Historical data D (2017-2022), External factors E (GDP, urbanization rate, etc.)
1: // Data Preprocessing
2: Clean D by removing missing values and outliers
3: Normalize D to [0,1] range
4: Generate feature matrix X from D and E
5: Split data into training set Dtrain and testing set Dtest
6: // Model Building
7: Initialize linear regression model LR and LSTM model L
8: Train LR using Dtrain with features [GDP, urbanization, pet ownership, income]
9: Configure L with architecture [LSTM(64, dropout=0.2), Dense(1)]
10: Train L using Dtrain for 100 epochs with batch size 32
11: // Prediction Generation
12: For each future time point t in (2024-2026) do
13:    Generate prediction PLR using LR
14:    Generate prediction PL using L
15:    Compute final prediction Pt = w1*PLR + w2*PL
16: End for
17: // Evaluation
18: Compute metrics (MAPE, RMSE) on Dtest
19: Generate confidence intervals for predictions

20: Return Final predictions P, evaluation metrics M
